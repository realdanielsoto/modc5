# Task Board 

Welcome to my **Task Board (modc5)** project. This is part of my coding adventures, and I'm building a super simple Kanban-style task board to keep track of tasks. It's powered by **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and a bit of **Day.js** magic!

## What's This All About? 

This project helps you:
- Organize tasks into three columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks on the fly.  
- Keep tasks saved in your browser with **localStorage** (no losing progress here!).
- See color-coded tasks:  
  - **Red** = overdue,  
  - **Yellow** = close to the deadline.  
- Drag and drop tasks to move them around like a pro.

## The Big Idea 

**AS** someone juggling too many tasks,  
**I WANT** a way to keep everything in one place,  
**SO THAT** I can stop forgetting stuff and crush my to-do list. 

---

## Cool Features 

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly create new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- **Drag-and-Drop Magic:** Move tasks between columns with ease.
- **Color Alerts:** Know what's urgent at a glance with colors.
- **Local Storage:** Your tasks stay put even if you refresh the page.  
- **Delete Tasks:** Clean up by removing completed or irrelevant tasks.
